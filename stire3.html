            An artist in Ukraine captures the war in black and white

              "Since the beginning of the war, my main focus has been to show
              this war through photography," says Vladyslav Krasnoshchok, a
              medical doctor and artist in the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv.<br /><br />

              After Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, the country's
              second-largest city, Kharkiv, came under siege for nearly three
              months. The center of the northeastern city is just 30 miles from
              the Russian border. Russian troops quickly advanced on Kharkiv and
              pounded it for weeks with mortars, heavy artillery and cruise
              missiles. Hundreds of thousands of people fled, while others took
              shelter in cellars and the city's underground metro stations.<br /><br />

              Krasnoshchok stayed put even as others sought safety farther west
              or left the country. But he didn't want to use underground bomb
              shelters.<br /><br />

              "I never used basements or anything like that," he says, "because
              it's damp down there. It's cold and dark. I don't need that."<br /><br />

              Krasnoshchok, who's 41, describes himself as a "geopolitical
              surrealist" painter. Once the war started, he wanted to document
              the way the invasion dramatically changed the country.

            "I only work with the physical photos," he says about his choice to
            use an Olympus Pen S 35 mm camera from the 1980s loaded with
            black-and-white film rather than a modern digital camera. He
            develops the film himself and prints his images at his home in one
            of Kharkiv's residential neighborhoods. "I really believe my work
            differs a lot from the digital images because it's actually in front
            of you," he says. "This is, like, actual art, and this is really
            important for history."

            During the early part of the war, Krasnoshchok started wandering the
            empty streets of Kharkiv with his camera. It was still winter. The
            snow contrasted sharply against the blackened, bombed-out apartment
            buildings.<br /><br />

            "In just a 1 1/2 kilometer [almost 1 mile] radius from my house,
            there's a lot of destruction here," he says. "They've been shelling
            here a lot."<br /><br />

            He says he found the stark, destroyed landscapes visually striking.
            "They remind me of some kind of post-apocalyptic pictures of cities
            like Chernobyl or Detroit," he says.

            "Why do black and white? Because, with this method, I am fully
            controlling the whole process," he says. "From the moment I'm taking
            a picture, to using the chemicals, to actually printing it, to
            framing it — this is the purest way of making photography."

            Krasnoshchok really wanted to do something creatively different from
            the many photographers documenting the war. "Everybody shoots with
            digital now," he says. "There are so many of them, and I'm pretty
            sure that if we look at all of their works, we're going to see a
            similar pattern to how they do it. With this physical method, I
            really believe that it's going to allow me to find my own point of
            view."

          <p class="articles">
            "In my art, I'm trying to study the composition and the structure of
            the image and its influence on the observer," Krasnoshchok says. "I
            stay here mostly so I don't miss anything interesting."

            He's sent some of his negatives and some of his paintings to a
            friend's home in central Ukraine for safekeeping. He posts many of
            his photos on Instagram.<br /><br />

            But he grew up in Kharkiv. His house was passed down to him by his
            father. It's not just that Krasnoshchok doesn't want to leave, he
            wants to be here in his home city at this moment.
          </p>
          <img class="container-fluid my-2" src="img/war9.png" />
          <p class="articles">
            "A war, it's a unique thing," Krasnoshchok says. "Sometimes in a
            lifetime you have it once. Sometimes you don't have it at all."<br /><br />
            As an artist, he wants to absorb it. He says he isn't worried about
            getting killed or a bomb dropping on his house because that's out of
            his control.<br /><br />
            "I keep 90% of all of my art, all my belongings here because I
            believe that if a missile hits here or something happens here, I'm
            mentally prepared to say goodbye to all of this," he says, gesturing
            to his living room, which is covered in his paintings. "This is a
            wooden house — if something comes here, it's going to be absolute
            destruction."<br /><br />
            Krasnoshchok says he makes his art first for himself and then he
            hopes that through his art, the viewer ends up seeing the world
            differently.
