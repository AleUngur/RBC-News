              Elon Musk wants to break off his agreement to buy Twitter.<br /><br />

              In a
              <a
                href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1418091/000110465922078413/tm2220599d1_ex99-p.htm"

              >
              to the company, filed Friday with the Securities and Exchange
              Commission, Musk accuses Twitter of making "false and misleading
              representations" about the prevalence of fake accounts on its
              platform. He says the company has not complied with its
              obligations to share data and information that he says he needs to
              evaluate its business.<br /><br />

              "Sometimes Twitter has ignored Mr. Musk's requests, sometimes it
              has rejected them for reasons that appear to be unjustified, and
              sometimes it has claimed to comply while giving Mr. Musk
              incomplete or unusable information," Musk's lawyer, Mike Ringler,
              wrote.<br /><br />

              Legal experts say this may not be sufficient grounds to break off
              the $44 billion deal without Musk being on the hook for a hefty
              fine. In response to Musk's letter, the chair of Twitter's board
              said it planned to sue.<br /><br />

              "The Twitter Board is committed to closing the transaction on the
              price and terms agreed upon with Mr. Musk and plans to pursue
              legal action to enforce the merger agreement. We are confident we
              will prevail in the Delaware Court of Chancery," said Bret Taylor
              in a tweet, referring to a Delaware court that handles corporate
              disputes.<br /><br />

              The billionaire CEO of Tesla and Space X struck a deal to buy the
              social media company back in April. But almost immediately, he
              started hinting – and then saying outright – that he had cold
              feet. In May he declared the purchase was "on hold" while he
              looked into Twitter's accounting of how many users are not real
              people, but automated bots or spam. Soon after, Twitter agreed to
              give him access to its "firehose" – a real-time stream of more
              than 500 million tweets posted every day. Since then, the two
              sides have been sharing information and working to close the
              transaction.<br /><br />

              On Thursday, the
              <a
                href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/07/07/elon-musk-twitter-jeopardy/"
                target="_blank"
                >Washington Post reported</a
              >
              the deal was "in jeopardy" because Musk doubts that Twitter's spam
              figures are verifiable. His team was "expected to take potentially
              drastic action," the Post reported.<br /><br />

              Bots may not be the only factor in Musk's change of heart. While
              his offer of $54.20 a share was initially seen as a lowball price
              for Twitter, given that it was trading above $70 last year, tech
              stocks and the market as a whole have fallen sharply since he
              struck the deal.<br /><br />

              As of the closing bell on Friday, Twitter shares were trading
              around $37 – down nearly 30% from the day Musk's purchase was
              announced. In May, Musk even said he might seek to negotiate a
              lower price.<br /><br />

              On Thursday, Twitter had pointed to a statement the company issued
              in June saying it "has and will continue to cooperatively share
              information" with Musk and that "we intend to close the
              transaction and enforce the merger agreement at the agreed price
              and terms." The company was expecting to hold a shareholder vote
              on the deal by mid-August.<br /><br />
            </p>
            <h3>Musk signed a merger agreement</h3>
            <p class="articles">
              The two sides signed a legal agreement that Musk would buy Twitter
              for $54.20 a share. If either side broke off the deal, they could
              be on the hook to pay a $1 billion fee to the other party.<br /><br />

              In his letter on Friday, Musk cites Twitter's alleged refusal to
              turn over more information about bots as grounds to abandon the
              deal. But legal experts say that would be an uphill battle.<br /><br />

              For years, Twitter has publicly said it estimates less than 5% of
              daily users who see ads are spam or bots (but has also cautioned
              the number could be higher).<br /><br />

              Musk disputes this, saying he believes as many as 20% of accounts
              may be fake. While Twitter gave Musk access to its firehose of
              public data, it told reporters this week its spam estimates are
              also based on private data, such as users' IP addresses, phone
              numbers, locations and behavior – and are therefore difficult for
              outsiders to verify.<br /><br />

              Even if Twitter's 5% figure is incorrect, that still might not be
              enough to let Musk back out or change the terms of the deal
              without paying a hefty price.<br /><br />

              "Merger agreements are drafted to avoid exactly what Musk is
              doing, which is try to find some tiny little false thing and then
              say, 'Whoops, I get to walk away now," said Ann Lipton, a business
              law professor at Tulane University Law School. "They specifically
              say things like, you can't back out unless it's not just false,
              but incredibly false, hugely false, massively damaging to the
              company."<br /><br />
            </p>
            <h3>Twitter has a strong case against Musk, say experts</h3>
            <p class="articles">
              The merger agreement includes what's known as a "specific
              performance clause," which says Twitter can take Musk to court to
              force him to go through with the purchase as long as he still has
              financing in place.<br /><br />

              While that may sound risky – and costly – for Twitter, Lipton says
              the company's case would be "very strong," and its board has
              compelling incentives to see the sale through. Investors are
              expecting to receive $54.20 a piece for their shares. The board's
              view, according to a person familiar with the deal talks, is that
              the sale agreement with Musk is the most valuable part of Twitter
              right now.<br /><br />

              "They would much rather have the $54.20 without a court fight, but
              it's worth fighting over," Lipton said. Given the company's
              current share price, "$54.20 seems like an unbelievable deal for
              Twitter. So there is a lot that they could sacrifice that would
              still make it worth it in the end if they got to force Musk to
              close."<br /><br />
            </p>
            <h3>Musk might try to get Twitter at a discount</h3>
            <p class="articles">
              Still, some Wall Street analysts say Twitter's board and
              management should be open to accepting a lower price to avoid a
              lengthy legal battle.<br /><br />

              "There's no chance it's getting done at $54.20," said Angelo Zino,
              analyst at CFRA Research. "You're either going to see a 15 to 20%
              drop in the offer price to get Elon Musk engaged again, or he
              continues to play the bot card."<br /><br />

              Taking Musk to court could be even more damaging to Twitter at a
              time when uncertainty over the deal and what the billionaire's
              ownership might mean are weighing heavily on the company. Morale
              is already low and some employees are leaving. CEO Parag Agrawal
              has shaken up his executive ranks and announced a hiring freeze
              and spending cuts.<br /><br />

              Going to court "doesn't bode well for the business prospects of
              your company, and it further adds uncertainty to the employee
              base," Zino said.<br /><br />

              That's also a risk for Musk, Lipton said. "What if he has to buy
              the company and now he's kind of undermined it at the same
              time?"<br /><br />

              Ultimately, she said, the billionaire's antics, however chaotic,
              appear to have a single goal: "I don't think he's committed to
              winning. I think he's committing to not spending $44 billion on
              Twitter."
