              Cleaning is a fundamental part of life. We have to clean
              ourselves, our clothes, our dishes, our homes – and for each of
              these tasks, there are countless products filled with ingredients
              with names so long and complicated, we have no idea what they
              are.<br /><br />

              "There has to be a better way to clean our homes and not have to
              worry about what we are spraying [all over our homes]," says
              Stephanie Moram, who runs the website Good Girl Gone Green and
              hosts the podcast Green Junkie.<br /><br />

              When she first started thinking about environmentally-friendly
              cleaning and living, Moram was just curious about the products she
              was using, and their impact on her family's health and the
              environment. Now, she makes her own cleaning products, practices
              zero-waste living and researches brands to make sure they're both
              sustainable and ethical before making a purchase.<br /><br />

              Practicing green cleaning isn't zero-sum, says Moram. "You don't
              have to throw out everything in your house to live sustainably,"
              she says.<br /><br />

              Think of your journey to sustainable living as being on a spectrum
              of greens. "No matter where you fall, if it's mint green or dark
              green or lime green or really dark forest green, it doesn't
              matter," she says. "We're all just moving forward together and
              doing the best we can."<br /><br />

              If you're interested in more sustainable cleaning, here are some
              tips to get you started:<br /><br />
            </p>
            <h3>Invest in items you can reuse</h3>
            <img
              class="container-fluid my-2"
              src="img/cleaning2.png"
              alt="image"
            />
            <p class="articles">
              Replace paper towels and sponges with old t-shirts and Swedish
              dishcloths.<br /><br />

              "Swedish dishcloths are super...absorbent and you can keep reusing
              them," says Moram. They're spongy towels made from cellulose and
              cotton, which means they can be washed and reused, and when you're
              ready to throw them out, they'll eventually decompose.<br /><br />
            </p>
            <h3>Look for ways to cut back on packaging for products you buy</h3>
            <img
              class="container-fluid my-2"
              src="img/cleaning3.png"
              alt="image"
            />
            <p class="articles">
              Next time you're ready to buy laundry detergent, think about how
              it's packaged. Liquid detergent usually comes in a plastic
              container and it can be pretty heavy. "That has an environmental
              impact," says Moram, from how much space it takes up in a shipping
              container to how much water is used in the liquid detergent
              itself.<br /><br />

              Instead, Moram uses laundry strips, which look like strips of
              paper packed with concentrated cleaning agents which dissolve in
              the wash cycle. "It comes pretty much in an envelope ... and all I
              do is rip off a strip and I put it in the washing machine," she
              explains. "Overall, it's less expensive, it's less packaging and
              ... you'll be able to transport more of that to people versus one
              big jug of laundry detergent."<br /><br />

              You can buy other cleaning products like hand washing soap and
              surface or mirror cleaners in tablet form. Just mix them with
              water at home in a reusable bottle.<br /><br />

              If you already have big bottles of detergent, you can refill them
              at refill stores instead of buying fresh bottles. While you're
              there, you can also refill shampoo, soap and other cleaning
              products.<br /><br />
            </p>
            <h3>Read labels – and don't fall for buzz words</h3>
            <img
              class="container-fluid my-2"
              src="img/cleaning4.png"
              alt="image"
            />
            <p class="articles">
              When companies label their products with vague terms like
              "eco-friendly" or "non-toxic," it doesn't mean much.<br /><br />

              Companies will often advertise certain ingredients that aren't in
              their products, without providing more information. "They might
              replace it with something that's equally as bad, but it's not an
              ingredient that people look for," Moram explains.<br /><br />

              Instead, Moram suggests focusing on reading ingredient labels to
              see what products do contain. Anything with "fragrance" on its
              ingredient list is best to avoid: "Companies are not required to
              disclose what the actual makeup of that fragrance is, and a lot of
              fragrances are mostly chemicals or not plant-derived unless you're
              using some sort of essential oil in there," she says.<br /><br />

              The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has this resource to
              identify cleaning products that are actually environmentally
              friendly.<br /><br />

              Moram will often look up unfamiliar ingredients with the
              Environmental Working Group, an advocacy organization that
              specializes in researching toxins and pollutants and advocating
              for corporate accountability.<br /><br />
            </p>
            <h3>Make your own simple-formula cleaning products<br /></h3>
            <p class="articles">
              If you're ready to go from mint green to avocado or even forest
              green on the color spectrum of green living, you can make your own
              cleaning products using a few simple recipes. DIY products can
              save you a lot of money, and by making your own cleaners at home,
              you're eliminating the environmental impact of packaging and
              transportation.<br /><br />

            />
            <p class="articles">
              <b>Supplies:</b>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  ¼ cup of vinegar
                </li>
                <li>
                  About ¾ cups of water
                </li>
                <li>
                  Spray bottle
                </li>
                <li>
                  Essential oil, optional
                </li>
              </ul>
              <b>Directions:</b> Mix water and vinegar in a spray bottle, and use that to 
              spray your floors before wiping with a mop or rag.<br/><br/>

              If you're not a fan of the sour smell vinegar can have, Moram suggests 
              adding a few drops of essential oils, like citrus, lavender or pine, or you can 
              open your windows for a little while until the smell dissipates.<br/><br/>
            </p>
            <h3>Hydrogen peroxide dezinfectant</h3>
            <p class="articles">
              For a stronger disinfectant for your bathroom or kitchen, Moram suggests a diluted hydrogen peroxide mix.<br/><br/>
              <b>Supplies:</b>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  1/2 cup hydrogen peroxide
                </li>
                <li>
                  1/2 cup water
                </li>
                <li>
                  spray bottle
                </li>
              </ul>
              <b>Directions: </b>
              Mix together and use to disinfect.<br/><br/>
              Unlike with a vinegar solution, which you can wipe immediately, "with peroxide, you need to let it sit for a few minutes," Moram says. For example, if you want to disinfect your toilet seat or bathroom counters, you can spray your hydrogen peroxide solution onto the surfaces you want to treat, go clean another area of your home, and then come back to wipe down your bathroom.<br/><br/>
              *Be sure to use gloves if you're cleaning with hydrogen peroxide.<br/><br/>
              Whatever you do, make sure you do not mix hydrogen peroxide with vinegar in the same bottle. That makes a potentially toxic acid that can be harmful to your health.<br/><br/>
            </p>
          <h3>The many uses of baking soda</h3>
          <img

          />
          <p class="articles">
            A paste of baking soda and water makes a good scrub for your sink or bathtub. Or you can unclog your sink by sprinkling some baking soda down the drain, adding vinegar and letting it sit for 15 minutes. Wash it all down with hot water and your drain should be back in business.
