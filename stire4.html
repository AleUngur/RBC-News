              Another deadly mass shooting in America. Another community in
              mourning. Another news cycle spent discussing the gunman, the
              investigation, the missed signals — and most importantly, the
              lives lost.<br /><br />

              But in the shadows of these stories are the survivors; those who
              escape mass shootings with their lives, but must find a way to
              manage the injuries, the memories and the trauma.<br /><br />

              And with every new attack that makes headlines, it all comes
              rushing back.<br /><br />

              "It was heartbreaking," says Phil Andrew about the Highland Park
              shooting on July 4. "To know that once again, in America, somebody
              was able to access a dangerous military assault-style weapon and
              rain bullets down on what should have been an enjoyable day ...
              shattering lives."<br /><br />

              The Chicago suburb's annual July 4th parade ended in tragedy after
              a gunman opened fire on the crowd, killing seven people and
              injuring dozens more. The attack hit close to home for Andrew, who
              survived a mass shooting 34 years ago. It took place just a few
              miles away from the Highland Park attack at an elementary school
              in neighboring Winnetka, Illinois.<br /><br />

                >That tragic day</a
              >, a woman armed with handguns entered a 2nd grade classroom and
              opened fire, killing an 8-year-old boy and injuring five others.
              Afterwards, she fled the scene then entered the Andrew house and
              held his family hostage for more than an hour. Phil, who was 20
              years old at the time, was home from college on the first day of
              spring break and convinced her to let the rest of his family leave
              if he agreed to stay with her. Eventually, she shot Phil.<br /><br />

              "A bullet ripped through my chest, both of my lungs, severed my
              esophagus and grazed my pericardium," he recalls. "I was very
              lucky to survive."

              Now a 54-year-old consultant and former FBI special agent, he said
              his experience inspired him to get into law enforcement and try to
              prevent more shootings.<br /><br />

              "Immediately, even before I left the hospital, I realized that my
              way forward was to make sure that I understood what happened," he
              said. "And play a role in making sure it wouldn't happen
              again."<br /><br />

              He especially remembers the people who tended to his wounds after
              being shot, who told him to stay awake and immediately started
              using swimmer terminology (Andrew was a swimmer in college) to
              convince him to power through.<br /><br />

              "One of the things that always stayed with me was that there were
              people there for me on the worst day of my life," he said. "There
              were amazingly heroic first responders who came to me at great
              risk to themselves, literally entering into a scene where they
              were putting themselves at risk to render aid ... and really
              somewhere in there, they also were challenging me with what I was
              going to do with this kind of gift I was given."

            <img
              class="container-fluid my-2"

            <p class="articles">
              And it has become his life's work. Andrew is now Archdiocese of
              Chicago's Violence Prevention Initiatives and has served on the
              City of Chicago's Office of Violence Prevention Advisory, the
              Governor of Illinois' Public Safety Transition Committee, and the
              Chicago Mayoral Public Safety and Accountability Transition
              Committee.<br /><br />

              And yet decades later, with the mass shootings showing no signs of
              stopping, he knows his work in gun violence prevention will
              probably never be done. In fact, it's harder than ever.<br /><br />

              The Highland Park attack was one of five mass shootings in the
              country that day alone. And the U.S. has already experienced more
              than 300 others so far in 2022, only halfway into the year — which
              averages out to more than 11 a week, according to the Gun Violence
              Archive, an independent data collection organization.<br /><br />

              The group defines a mass shooting as an incident in which four or
              more people are shot or killed, excluding the shooter.<br /><br />

              And the advocacy itself can be dangerous with the national
              conversation on gun control so volatile. The Andrew family even
              received a threatening phone call at the house one day. Phil's
              mother answered and was understandably upset afterward. She asked
              her son when all of this was going to stop.<br /><br />

              "And that was an 'aha' moment for us," he said. "My mother deeply
              wanted to see her family and her house and everything kind of
              return to normalcy. And I recognized that would never be again.
              That we had experienced something. And we would always be
              advocating and working to prevent it."<br /><br />
