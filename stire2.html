              Do you ever feel put out by too many social events? Fed up by all
              the work requests you feel pressure to say yes to? Bothered by
              small asks that make you feel big mad?<br /><br />

              It might be time to take a look at your boundaries.<br /><br />

              "A boundary is something that keeps you safe and comfortable in
              your relationships," says Nedra Glover Tawwab, a licensed
              therapist and author of Set Boundaries, Find Peace.<br /><br />

              Boundaries can look a lot of different ways depending on who makes
              them. "A boundary for you might not be a boundary for me because
              it is unique," says Tawwab. "It's based on who I am."<br /><br />

              Look for signs you might need a boundary<br /><br />
              Ignoring or compromising on your boundaries — like allowing
              yourself to be talked into activities you don't want to do — can
              lead to frustration, resentment, discomfort or passive-aggressive
              behavior, says Tawwab.<br /><br />

              Anxiety can also be an alarm bell for a breached boundary — like
              if you're feeling worked up ahead of interacting with a specific
              person or stressed in anticipation of declining a request. "Those
              [feelings] are indicators that perhaps there is space for
              boundaries in this situation," she explains.<br /><br />

              Once you've realized a commitment or situation isn't working for
              you, the next question is: "How do we make an agreement with
              ourselves to not exhaust ourselves in the same way in the
              future?"<br /><br />

              To answer that, Tawwab offers this guidance on how to set – and
              keep – boundaries in your everyday life.<br /><br />

              Practice setting boundaries on a daily basis<br /><br />

              <h3>Practice setting boundaries on a daily basis</h3><br />
              Like any new habit, boundary-setting requires practice. Here are
              some ways to hone your boundary setting:<br />

              * Do an honest assessment of what you're willing to tolerate.
              <br />
              * When you encounter something that doesn't feel good, create a
              boundary and communicate it. When you're feeling overextended, say
              so. We can't expect other people to know our capacity.<br />
              * Say no to requests that you don't actually have the time or
              energy to fulfill. You can practice different ways to decline.
              (There's a Life Kit episode for that.)<br /><br />

              <h3>Remember that boundaries help protect relationships, not stifle
                them</h3> If you're new to setting boundaries, starting to do so might
              affect your relationships – and that's OK!<br /><br />

              "We want to be in relationships with people," says Tawwab. "We
              just want to be less anxious, less overwhelmed, less drained, less
              frustrated with folks."<br /><br />

              For example, "If I have to say to you ... 'This is not a good time
              for me to talk because I'm really in my head about my stuff. I am
              not prepared to listen. Let me give you a call back a little
              later.' That is a way to preserve the relationship," she
              explains.<br /><br />

              If the person you're talking to isn't used to you drawing a line,
              you might get some pushback. They might even say you've changed.
              Tawwab says a self-honoring response to that is: "You are
              correct."<br /><br />

              If their next response is that they don't know how to treat you
              anymore, "Our job is to say, 'I will teach you. I will let you
              know the things that I need and want today,'" says Tawwab.<br /><br />

              When someone crosses a boundary, it's up to you to deliver the
              consequences<br /><br />
              There will be people who don't respect your boundaries. And while
              you can't control how people react, you can decide what happens
              next.<br /><br />

              Tawwab says to make sure you've clearly communicated that there is
              no room for negotiation on a matter: "At some point, we need to
              say, 'Stop.' They need to know that that door is closed."<br /><br />

              If that still doesn't work, "Sometimes it is ending the
              relationship," she says. "But I think more often we figure out
              different ways to be present with people."<br /><br />

              You can choose the frequency, duration and limitations of how
              you're in a relationship with a person, a role or an organization.
              (Hello work/life balance.)<br /><br />

              Boundaries start with you. Knowing your capacity and ability to
              respond to requests is the beginning of being able to teach others
              how to treat you.<br /><br />
